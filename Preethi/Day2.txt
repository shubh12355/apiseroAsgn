Day 2 - Programming Fundamentals	
OOPS Concepts
	1)Abstraction: Hiding the business logic from the user.
		       Providing only necessary information.
		       Loose coupling 
		       can be achieved by using interfaces and abstract classes

	2)Encapsulation: Binding data menbers with member functions of a class into single unit.
			 Making data members in a class as private, then providing access to them via public methods. 
		         Keeps the data and code safe within the class itself.
		 	 
	3)Inheritance: Inheriting features
		       A base class inherits the features of parent class
		       Types: Single, Multilevel,
		       ** Class can extend only one class and can implements many interfaces **
		       Multiple Inheritance:
				Java doesn't support extending multiple classes because if both classes have same method then compiler can't make a decision to execute which class method
				But multiple inheritance can be achieved through interfaces but not 100% because interface doesn't provide code reusability 
				-> Implementing multiple interfaces can give multiple inheritance to certain level
					 --> the definition of same methods is provided by implementing class not the interfaces, so no ambiguity  
		       - To have common data members among multiple classes
		       - Code Reusability
		       - Type (Interface)
		       - Tight coupling (Base class depends on super class)


	4)Polymorphism: Poly -> many and Morph -> form
			Doing a same task in different ways
			Method overloading and Method overriding
