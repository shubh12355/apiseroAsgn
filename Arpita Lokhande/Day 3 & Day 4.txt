Java-
-Source code->Compiler(javac)-> .class (Byte code) -> java -> Machine code.
-java allows maximum compile time exceptions.
-java 8 is used for functional programming.
-Provides various classes and default keywords and libraries.
-Platform independent.
-JRE is required on the platforms to run the byte code.

Naming Conventions in Java
-Class name should start with Capital letter.
-file name should be same as Public class name.
-libraries -> java.util,java.lang,java.sql, etc

-Java Abstract, Final.
Abstract Class->
-Abstract classes used for 1. Inheritance 2. Static
-Cannot create instance of Abstract class.
-Can create derived class from Abstract Class.
Abstract Method->
-Abstract method should be declared in Abstract class only.

Final Class->
-Can create instance of Abstract class.
-Cannot create derived class from Abstract Class.
Final Method->
-Final method cannot be overridden in derived class.

Interface in java->
-One Interface can extend another interface.
-Interfaces are just like pure abstract class.No data variables, no actual methods but only abstract methods.
-While implementating interface for a class-> Use interface as new Implementation class
-Interface i =new ImplementationClass()

Constructors in Java->
-If constructor is not mentioned, java creates default constructor.
-For inheritance, java initiates constructor of base class first and then derived class constructor.
-Constructors used for Object Initialization.

Access Modifiers in Java->
-Public, Private, Protected.

Exception Handling in java->
-Try block contains the code which may cause exception.
-Catch block catches the exception occured in try 
catch(Exception e)
{
throw e;
}
and throws it to client with Exception message. throw e.
-finally is a block in Java, it executes anyway.
-examples-> IndexOutOfBoundException, ArithmeticException,NullPointerException, etc.

Collection Frameworks in Java->
-Combination of interface, implementation and Algorithms.
-can be set, list and map.

-List is collection items and can be created using library java.util.ArrayList.
-List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();

-For set, there are many classes such as HashSet, TreeSet.
-HashSet->
  1.There are no duplications
  2.Has no ordering or can say has hash function ordering
  3.Set<Integer> h1  = new HashSet<>();
-TreeSet->
  1. There are no duplications
  2. has proper ordering, elements are sorted.
  3.Set<Integer> h1  = new TreeSet<>();

-Map is something which comes with Key Value Pair.
-For map, there are classes like HashMap, TreeMap
-HashMap->
    1.Map<String,Integer> map =new HashMap<>();
    2. Has functions such as put,remove,get.
-TreeMap->
    1.Map<String,Integer> map =new TreeMap<>();
    2. Has functions such as put,remove,get.

-MultiThreading in java->
-Multithreading is spliting work task into threads assigning each with equal amount of time.
-implemented by extending Thread class.
-Have to override run() method.
-In main method have to create object of thread and can call start() method.
