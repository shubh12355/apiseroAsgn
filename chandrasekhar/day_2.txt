-----------------OOPS Concepts------------------
->Abstraction:
		1. Hiding the implementation details/business logic from the user and showing only the details essential for the user.
		2. When using sort function, the actual implementation and logic is not known, only the parameters to be sent and return type is known.
	
->Encapsulation:
		1. Bundling the data members and member function together. 
		2. Data cannot be accessed directly, it can be accessed only through methods(getters and setters).
		3. Data members are declared as private, and corresponding member functions are declared public. 
		
->Inheritance:
		1. Inheritance is used when we have common data member between the classes.
		2. For code reuse, directly create instance and revoke the method instead of inheritance.
		3. For using super class as the type, use interface instead of inheritance. In java, interface supports multiple inheritance.
		
->Polymorphism:
		Poly - Many.
    morphs - forms.
    1. Member functions supporting many forms.
		2. When a method with same name and signature is in parent and child class, and if the object of the child called is made and the method is revoked then 
       child class method overrides the parent class method.
		3. Method with same name but different signatures is called method overloading.
