OOP:
		Abstraction:
		1. Hiding the core lofic form end user and only provding the essential details.
		2. You dont come to know how the particular method is being executed except for the arguments and the return type of the dunction. 
    3. Done for data security. 
		Encapsulation:
		1. Binding of the variables and methods in a class
		2. To access data, need special methods to retrieve and use it. The way it is done is different in various languages but the logic remains the same. 
		3. Encapsulation is needed to keep the reusability and mantainibility of code. 
		Inheritance:
		1. Inheritance is used when we have common data member between the 			
		classes.
		2. For code reuse, directly create instance and revoke the method instead of 			
		inheritance.
		3. For using super class as the type, use interface instead of inheritance. In 			
		java, interface supports multiple inheritance.
		Polymorphism:
		1. Poly - Multiple, morphism - forms. Member functions supporting many 			
		forms.
		2. When a method with same name and signature is in parent and child class, 			
		and if the object of the child called is made and the method is revoked then 			
		child class method overrides the parent class method.
		3. Method with same name but different signatures is called method 				
		overloading.
